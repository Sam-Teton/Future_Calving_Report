# Future_Calving_Report

As a consultant in the dairy industry I built an Excel report to help predict herd flow.

This report predicts future calf rates, future rate of genetic gain, and future herd distribution dynamics.

All reproduction, genetic, and histroric farm records are needed for this analysis.
Information is uploaded from farm management software. 

View the attached PDF files to see an example of the graph and the report.
